# Decision-Networks-
A decision network uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to represent a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies within a probabilistic model, while a decision network extends the Bayesian network to include decision nodes and utility nodes. There are three types of nodes: Rectangles represent decision nodes, Ovals represent chance nodes, and Diamonds represent utility nodes. Code to perform inference in Decision Networks of discrete variables.
